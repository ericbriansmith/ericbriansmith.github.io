<p>[Verse 1]<br>
You stood before creation<br>
Eternity in Your Hand<br>
You spoke the earth into motion<br>
My soul now to stand<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
You stood before my failure<br>
And carried the cross for my shame<br>
My sin weighed upon Your Shoulders<br>
My soul now to stand<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
So what could I say?<br>
And what could I do?<br>
But offer this heart, Oh God<br>
Completely to You<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
So I'll walk upon salvation<br>
Your Spirit alive in me<br>
This life to declare Your Promise<br>
My soul now to stand<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus][2x]<br>
So what could I say?<br>
And what could I do?<br>
But offer this heart, Oh God<br>
Completely to You<br>
<br>
[Chorus][4x]<br>
I'll stand<br>
With arms high and heart abandoned<br>
In awe of the One who gave it all<br>
I'll stand<br>
My soul Lord to You, surrendered<br>
All I am is Yours<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
So what could I say?<br>
And what could I do?<br>
But offer this heart, Oh God<br>
Completely to You</p>
