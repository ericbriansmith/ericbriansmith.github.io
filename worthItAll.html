  All I am Lord here before You<br />
  Reaching out for more<br />
  You're the promise never failing<br />
  You are my reward,<br />
  Jesus, You are my reward<br />
  <br />
  I let go of all I have just to have all of You<br />
  And no matter what the cost I will follow You<br />
  Jesus everything I've lost I have found in You<br />
  When I finally reach the end I'll say<br />
  You are worth it all<br />
  <br />
  There's no riches or earthly treasure<br />
  That will satisfy<br />
  Every longing is for You Jesus<br />
  Set this heart on fire<br />
  Oh, set this heart on fire<br />
  <br />
  <b>Chorus</b> <br>
  I let go of all I have just to have all of You<br />
  And no matter what the cost I will follow You<br />
  Jesus everything I've lost I have found in You<br />
  When I finally reach the end I'll say<br />
  You are worth it all<br />
  You are worth it all<br />
  <br />
  When I'm there in Your glorious presence<br />
  Every knee is bowed before You<br />
  Hear the sound of heaven singing<br />
  You are worth it all<br />
  All the saints cry holy holy<br />
  Angels singing worthy worthy<br />
  Forever I will shout Your praises<br />
  You are worth it all<br />
  <br />

  <b>Chorus</b> <br>
