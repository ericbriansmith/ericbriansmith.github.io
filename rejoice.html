  Come and stand before your maker<br />
  Full of wonder, full of fear;<br />
  Come behold his power and glory<br />
  Yet with confidence draw near,<br />
  For the one who holds the heavens<br />
  And commands the stars above<br />
  Is the God who bends to bless us<br />
  With an unrelenting love.<br />
  <br />
  Rejoice!<br />
  Come and lift your hands and raise your voice;<br />
  He is worthy of all praise,<br />
  Rejoice!<br />
  Sing the mercies of your King<br />
  And with trembling, rejoice.<br />
  <br />
  We are children of the promise,<br />
  The beloved of the Lord.<br />
  Won with everlasting kindness,<br />
  Bought with sacrificial blood.<br />
  Bringing reconciliation<br />
  To a world that longs to know<br />
  The affections of a father<br />
  Who will never let them go.<br />
  <br />
  All our sickness, all our sorrows<br />
  Jesus carried up the hill.<br />
  He has walked this path before us,<br />
  He is walking with us still;<br />
  Turning tragedy to triumph,<br />
  Turning agony to praise,<br />
  There is blessing in the battle<br />
  So take heart and stand amazed.<br />
