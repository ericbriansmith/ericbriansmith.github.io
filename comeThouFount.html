  Come thou fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing thy grace<br />
  Streams of mercy, never ceasing, call for songs of loudest praise<br />
  Teach me some melodious sonnet, sung by flaming tongues above<br />
  Praise the mount! I’m fixed upon it, Mount of God’s unchanging love<br />
  <br />
  Here I raise my Ebenezer, hither by thy help I come<br />
  And I hope by thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home<br />
  Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God<br />
  He to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood<br />
  <br />
  Oh, to grace how great a debtor, daily I’m constrained to be<br />
  Let thy goodness like a fetter; bind my wandering heart to Thee<br />
  Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love<br />
  Here’s my heart, Lord, take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above<br />
