  You know my every need<br>
  You see my poverty<br>
  You are enough for me, Jesus
  You gave the blind man sight<br>
  You raised the dead to life<br>
  You've done the same for me, Jesus<br>
  <br>
  You are loving, You are wise<br>
  There is nothing in my life You cannot revive<br>
  You are loving, You are wise<br>
  There is nothing too hard for our God<br>
<br>
  Your word inside of me<br>
  My strength, my everything<br>
  My hope will always be Jesus<br>
  Your breath inside my lungs<br>
  You're worthy of my trust<br>
  You will forever be Jesus<br>
  <br>
  You are loving, You are wise<br>
  There is nothing in my life You cannot revive<br>
  You are loving, You are wise<br>
  There is nothing too hard for our God<br>
<br>
  <b>Chorus</b><br>
  Nothing is wasted<br>
  You work all things for good<br>
  Nothing is wasted<br>
  Your promise remains<br>
  Forever You reign<br>
  <br>
  You are loving, You are wise<br>
  There is nothing in my life You cannot revive<br>
  You are loving, You are wise<br>
  There is nothing too hard for our God<br>
  <br>
  <b>Chorus</b>
