    <h3>Cancer type</h3>
      Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, a certain type of <a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/cancer-specialties/cancer-care-and-treatment/non-hodgkins-b-and-t-cell-lymphoma">Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma</a> <br />
      Classified as a <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/double-hit-lymphoma">Double Hit Lymphoma</a> <br />
    <h3>First Chemo Regimen (Sept 2017 through Dec)</h3>
      One round of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/R-CHOP">R-CHOP</a> followed by four rounds of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/R-EPOCH">R-EPOCH</a>. Each round required four nights in the hospital. They switched me to R-EPOCH after they found out it was a Double Hit Lymphoma. A <a href="https://imaging.cancer.gov/imaging_basics/cancer_imaging/nuclear_imaging.htm">PET scan</a> in January determined that this regimen would not be fully effective.
    <h3>Second Chemo Regimen (Jan 2018 through March)</h3>
      Two rounds of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/R-ICE">R-ICE</a> (two night hospital stays). A scan then showed that although the tumor got much smaller, it would not be effective enough. Since this treatment, I have not felt the abdominal pain from the tumor.
    <h3>CAR T-cell Therapy (May 2018)</h3>
      <a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/cancer-specialties/immunotherapy/car-t-cell-therapy">CAR T-cell</a> is a novel way to treat this type of lymphoma and in many patients, it brings complete remission. During my ten day stay at OSU James Hospital, I experienced fevers which indicated the modified T cells were recognizing the cancer. After one month, a PET scan showed that the cancer was inactive, which looked promising. Unfortunately my three month PET scan showed the cancer as active again.
    <h3>OSU clinical trial treatment (Aug through Oct 2018)</h3>
      My doctor recommended that I join a clinical trial that is being run at OSU using three drugs. They are all approved for use in different cancers, the trial is to determine the effectiveness of this combination for this lymphoma. This treatment requires no hospital stays. I just have to go in occasionally for an infusion (IV bag) of one drug. The other two drugs are pills I take at home. The cancer continued to progress during this treatment.

    <h3>R-DHAP chemo regimen (Oct 2018 through TBD)</h3>
      This treatment will require a two or three night stay in the hospital at OSU. <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancerinformation/cancertreatment/treatmenttypes/chemotherapy/combinationregimen/dhapr-dhap.aspx">Details</a>

    <h3 id="medDetails">Future possibility - Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant</h3>
      After getting response from a treatment, it would still be necessary to undergo an <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/allogeneic-stem-cell-transplantation?redirect=true">allogeneic stem cell transplant</a> (also referred to as a bone marrow transplant). This gives a greater chance for a long term remission. I would receive a donor's stem cells after receiving enough chemo to wipe out my own immune system. This would be in hopes that somebody else's immune system would not allow the cancer to relapse. They have already determined that there are several matches for me. The donors come from a national registry. In fact if you want to possibly save someone's life, you can register at <a href="https://bethematch.org/">bethematch.org</a>. If you were selected and wanted to donate, you would only have to give some stem cells via apheresis, which is not much more difficult than giving blood (I did this prior to CAR-T cell therapy). Since I can probably never do this, it would make me happy to hear that one of my friends got to donate!
