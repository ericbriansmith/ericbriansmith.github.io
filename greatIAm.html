I want to be close, close to your side<br>
So heaven is real and death is a lie<br>
I wanna hear voices of angels above<br>
Singing as one<br>
<br>
Hallelujah Holy Holy<br>
God almighty Great I am<br>
Who is worthy<br>
None beside Thee<br>
God Almighty<br>
Great I Am<br>
<br>
I want to be near, near to your heart<br>
Loving the world hating the dark<br>
I want to see dry bones living again<br>
Singing as one<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus</b><br>
Hallelujah<br>
Holy Holy<br>
God almighty Great I am<br>
Who is worthy<br>
None beside Thee<br>
God Almighty<br>
Great I Am...<br>
<br>
The mountains shake before Him<br>
The demons run and flee<br>
At the mention of the name<br>
King of Majesty<br>
There is no power in hell<br>
Or any who can stand<br>
Before the power and the presence of the Great I am<br>
The Great I am...<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
The mountains shake before Him<br>
The demons run and flee<br>
At the mention of the name<br>
King of Majesty<br>
There is no power in hell<br>
Or any who can stand<br>
Before the power and the presence of the Great I am...<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
