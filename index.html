      <p>
        First treatment is going well today. There were some chances for negative reactions, but I didn't experience anything, thank you God. I received an infusion (IV) of chemo and started taking pills for two of the medications. With that and some other meds, I will have to take about 13 pills per day for most of the month. I will be able to go home and hopefully continue working this week (minus a quick visit tomorrow again for labs). We are hoping that I can keep about 30 hours per week going forward.

      <p><b>Erin:</b> The clinical trial starts this week. Eric will be at the hospital all day Weds for an infusion of one drug and then waiting around for labs 8 hours after. Recheck labs again Thurs. He will also take two other lymphoma drugs as pills at home. There will be a total of three infusions in the first four week cycle, two infusions in the second four week cycle, then they will scan. If there's a decent or complete remission at the end of the two cycles he will go directly to stem cell transplant, and preparations for that are already happening. Prayer that Eric will defy the odds and feel great and be able to put in hours of work either from the office or from home. Prayer that his white cell counts recover appropriately so that the second cycle isn't delayed.</p>

      <h3>August 8, 2018</h3>
      <p><b>Erin:</b> Met with doc yesterday. The goal is to try to get a 1) temporary remission with a clinical trial combination of lymphoma drugs so that he can qualify for an 2) allogenic (donor) stem cell transplant, which has a chance for a cure. The clinical trial lasts two months and will start in a couple weeks. In the meantime they have to get new baselines on everything, so he has a tumor biopsy today, bone marrow biopsy next week, extra labs etc.
        <br>
        Specific prayer points: <br>
        1) that Eric's body would be cured if it's Jesus' will, and in the meantime will be supernaturally strengthened against the barrage of high intensity drugs he will be receiving (most of which can cause secondary cancers in addition to a myriad of other issues). God has already done this once... Eric's previous treatments have totaled 25 days of continuous chemo, and he didn't lose even 1 pound of weight.<br>
        2) For our kids, especially Evalyn, that she would understand an age appropriate but accurate biblical theology on Jesus' death and resurrection and how that gives us hope when our bodies wear out. And we thank God for all the support we have for our kids. This will be a long road.<br>
        3) That we would be able to enjoy each day despite the looming stuff. That I would be grateful for the medical system and not keep wishing I could find some magic organic tree bark or chia paste that would do a better job at healing Eric.</p>
