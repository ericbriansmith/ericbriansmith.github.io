<p><strong>VERSE 1<br />
</strong>Arise, my soul, arise<br />
Shake off your guilty fears<br />
The bleeding sacrifice<br />
On my behalf appears<br />
Before the throne my surety stands<br />
Before the throne my surety stands<br />
My name is written on His hands</p>
<p><strong>VERSE 2<br />
</strong>He ever lives above<br />
For me to intercede<br />
His all redeeming love<br />
His precious blood to plead<br />
His blood atoned for every race<br />
His blood atoned for every race<br />
And sprinkles now the throne of grace</p>
<p><strong>CHORUS<br />
</strong>O my soul, arise<br />
Behold the risen Christ<br />
Your Great High Priest<br />
Your spotless sacrifice<br />
O my soul, arise<br />
God owns you as His child<br />
Shake off your guilty fears<br />
My soul, arise</p>
<p><strong>VERSE 3<br />
</strong>Five bleeding wounds He bears<br />
Received on Calvary<br />
They pour effectual prayers<br />
They strongly plead for me:<br />
“Forgive him, O forgive,” they cry<br />
“Forgive him, O forgive,” they cry<br />
“Don’t let that ransomed sinner die!”</p>
<p><strong>VERSE 4<br />
</strong>My God is reconciled<br />
His pard’ning voice I hear<br />
He owns me as His child<br />
I can no longer fear<br />
With confidence I now draw nigh<br />
With confidence I now draw nigh<br />
And “Father, Abba, Father,” cry</p>
